# IEMDB â€“ React Frontend

This repository contains the React-based frontend for the IMDB-like movie platform, developed as part of the **Internet Engineering** course at the **University of Tehran** (Spring 2022).

This dynamic frontend replaced the static HTML/CSS templates in later development phases and provides full interaction with the backend.

## Features
- Built with React and integrated with Spring Boot backend
- Interactive UI for login, signup, movie listings, user watchlists, comments, and ratings
- Uses Axios for API calls and React Router for page navigation

## Notes
- Designed to work with the backend hosted in the main IEMDB backend repository.
- Fully containerized and deployable via Docker and Kubernetes.
